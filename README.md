# Swift-Singleton-Template


### About
***
This is a **bare-basic** Singleton written in Swift (Compatiable with 2.1 to 3) and claiming inhhertience of the NSObject class. **However** you are able to change this to nothing or another object of your choice.


### What is a Singleton
***
A Singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. - In short, a Singleton is instantiated once and can be used throughout your app without having to recreate the object, deinit, or pass the object, over and over.


### How to use
***
1. Download the ```Singleton.swift``` File. 
2. Copy it into your project
3. Rename the File and Class to whatever you want your Singleton to be named.
4. Create methods/variables/constants for that Singleton
5. Call those methods through your app such as... 
```Swift
Singleton.sharedInstance.method()
Singleton.sharedInstance.variable
```
